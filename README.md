# 🎬 Netflix Recommendation System

This project uses SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to build a movie recommendation system.

I used a sample movie ratings dataset and built a collaborative filtering model. I also evaluated the model using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

## 📌 What I Learned
- Basics of recommendation systems
- How to apply SVD for collaborative filtering
- How to evaluate predictions using RMSE

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Output
- Predicted movie ratings for users
- RMSE score printed at the end
